\f0\fs24 \cf0 Excellent catch. Yes, **envelope estimates are a critical step** and should be on the checklist. It's the bridge between defining requirements and choosing patterns/technology.\
\
Here is the **updated checklist** with the estimation step integrated at the right point.\
\
### \uc0\u9989  **UPDATED Solutions Architect Case Study Checklist**\
\
#### **STEP 0: THE OPENING (First 60 Seconds)**\
- [ ] **Restate & Align:** "Let me make sure I understand. The core goal is to **[state goal]** because of **[pain point]**, correct?"\
- [ ] **Seek Permission:** "Before I propose a solution, may I ask a few clarifying questions?"\
\
#### **STEP 1: CLARIFY & SCOPE (Q&A Phase)**\
*(Ask questions from at least 3 categories)*\
- [ ] **Business Goals:** Primary driver? (Cost, Speed, Risk, Compliance)\
- [ ] **Users & Functions:** Who are they? What are their key tasks?\
- [ ] **Non-Functional (RASCAL):** Latency, Availability, Scale, Security needs?\
- [ ] **Current State:** What exists today? Biggest pain point?\
- [ ] **Constraints:** Timeline, budget, tech mandates?\
- [ ] **Scale Estimation:** "To size the solution, what's the **user/transaction volume** and **data size**?" *(CRITICAL ADDITION)*\
\
#### **STEP 2: DEFINE REQUIREMENTS (Your "Part I")**\
- [ ] **Business Goal:** State a crisp, one-line *why*.\
- [ ] **Functional Requirements:** List 2-3 things the system must *do*.\
- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements:** Define 2-3 measurable **RASCAL** targets.\
\
#### **STEP 3: SIZE THE PROBLEM (Envelope Estimates)**\
- [ ] **Perform Quick Math:** Based on answers, estimate **QPS (Queries Per Second)**, **data volume/day**, **peak concurrent users**.\
- [ ] **Draw Conclusion:** State what this means for the architecture (e.g., "This is moderate scale, so a managed database is sufficient").\
\
#### **STEP 4: PROPOSE STRATEGY (Your "Part II")**\
- [ ] **Architectural Principles:** State 1-2 guiding stars (e.g., "Security-First," "Loose Coupling").\
- [ ] **Key Patterns:** Name 1-2 patterns from your **10-Pattern List** that fit the **Problem Family**.\
\
#### **STEP 5: HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN (Your "Part III")**\
- [ ] **Phased Approach:** Outline Phase 1 (Pilot/Foundation), Phase 2 (Scale), Phase 3 (Optimize).\
- [ ] **Diagram Description:** Describe the boxes and arrows. "Clients \uc0\u8594  API Gateway \u8594  Services..."\
- [ ] **First Enabler Feature:** Name the first concrete work item for the backlog.\
\
#### **STEP 6: TECHNOLOGY & EXECUTION (Your "Parts IV & V")**\
- [ ] **Technology Selection:** Justify 2-3 key tech choices, linking them to requirements **and scale estimates**.\
- [ ] **Risks & Mitigations:** Identify 1-2 key risks and your mitigation plan.\
- [ ] **Explicit Trade-off:** State one conscious trade-off (e.g., "We trade initial complexity for long-term agility").\
- [ ] **Next Step:** Propose the immediate next action (e.g., "A 2-day discovery sprint").\

### \uc0\u55358 \u56810  **Let's Test the Updated Checklist**\
Using the same warm-up scenario, let's practice integrating the **new Step 3**.\
\
**Scenario:** *"The login page for our crew portal loads very slowly when over 100 users are online."*\
\
**Assume you asked your clarifying questions and got these answers:**\
*   *"We have 5,000 total crew members. Peak is 500 concurrent logins in the morning. The page makes 10 API calls on load."*\
\
**Your Task:** Provide **Step 3: Size the Problem**.\
1.  Do the **quick math** for the load.\
2.  State the **architectural conclusion**.\
\
*(Example: "500 users * 10 calls = ~5,000 QPS at peak. This is high. The bottleneck is likely the backend API, not the frontend, so we need to optimize there.")*\
\
**Please provide your estimate and conclusion.** This will lock in the new step.}
